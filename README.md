# Real-Time Face Authentication System
A Python-based real-time face authentication system using OpenCV, NumPy, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for secure, contactless user verification through facial recognition.
# Project Overview
Real-Time Face Authentication System is a Python-based system designed to perform facial recognition in real-time. The system uses OpenCV for video capture and face detection and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate face recognition. The project is suitable for applications like secure logins, smart attendance systems, or automated access control.
By leveraging deep learning and computer vision techniques, the system ensures fast and accurate face verification, with minimal user interaction, providing a secure and contactless alternative to traditional authentication methods.
# Features
* Real-time face detection and authentication via webcam
* Custom CNN for facial recognition
* Utilizes OpenCV for video processing and face tracking
* NumPy for image preprocessing and data manipulation
* Robust to variations in lighting, angle, and facial expressions
* Easy to extend with new datasets and model adjustments

# Technologies Used
* Python (Programming Language)
* OpenCV (Face detection and video processing)
* NumPy (Data manipulation and preprocessing)
* TensorFlow/Keras (Deep learning framework for CNN)
* CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) (Face recognition model)
# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:
* Python 3.x
* pip (Python package installer)
You will also need access to a webcam for real-time video capture.
## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-authentication-system.git
cd face-authentication-system
Create a virtual environment (recommended):
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Setup
Prepare Dataset
Collect face images for each person you want to authenticate. Images should be stored in directories named after the person's name:

bash
Copy
Edit
/dataset
  /person1
    image1.jpg
    image2.jpg
  /person2
    image1.jpg
    image2.jpg
Alternatively, you can use the script collect_faces.py to capture images directly from your webcam.

Train the Model
Train the face recognition model using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train_model.py
Run the Authentication System
Once the model is trained, run the real-time face authentication system:

bash
Copy
Edit
python face_auth.py
# How It Works
* Face Detection:
The system uses OpenCV to detect faces in real-time from a live webcam feed.
* Preprocessing:
Each detected face is preprocessed (resized, normalized, and aligned) using NumPy for efficient processing before feeding it into the CNN model.
* CNN for Recognition:
The face is passed through a trained CNN model, which extracts facial features and compares them to stored embeddings of known faces.
* Authentication:
If the facial features match an existing identity in the database, the system authenticates the user.
# Future Improvements
Implement FaceNet or DeepFace for more accurate face embeddings.
Support for recognizing unknown faces and handling false positives/negatives.
Add a Flask web interface for a browser-based authentication system.
Improve performance by using GPU acceleration for deep learning training and inference.
